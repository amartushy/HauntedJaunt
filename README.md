Dot product (Melanie): Added an arrow fixed above the player character that 
rotates such that it points to the exit at all times (regardless of player 
location or direction) Dot product is used to calculate the difference between
the arrow's rotation in a given frame and the direction it should point (towards
the exit object) and the rotation is adjusted accordingly.

Gems + Particle Effect (Adrian) : Placed 5 gems around the playable area with a custom particle effect on "pickup" (collision with player). Gem assets obtained via free
